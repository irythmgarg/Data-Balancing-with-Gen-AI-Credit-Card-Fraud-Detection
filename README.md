# Data-Balancing-with-Gen-AI-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

In this project, you will learn how to leverage Generative AI for data generation to address data imbalance. 
SecureTrust Financial Services, a financial institution, has asked us to help them improve the accuracy of their fraud detection system.
The model is a binary classifier, but it's not performing well due to data imbalance.
As data scientists, we will employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a subset of Generative AI, to create synthetic fraudulent transactions that closely resemble real transactions. 
This approach aims to balance the dataset and enhance the accuracy of the fraud detection model.
